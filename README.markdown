My Fish Shell Config
====================

My [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) configuration files.

Installation
------------

1. Install [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/)

3. `git clone https://github.com/seanh/fish.git ~/.config/fish`

4. Run `fish`.

   **Tip**: Rather than changing your login shell to fish (with `chsh`), set
   `fish` as a custom command for your terminal emulator (or one profile of
   your terminal emulator) to run instead of your login shell. This is a less
   invasive change, and if something goes wrong with fish or your fish config
   then until you fix it you can just run a different terminal emulator or
   profile and get bash
